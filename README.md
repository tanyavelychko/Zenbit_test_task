This app is made using React Native as well as Redux, React Navigation, Async Storage and Native Base. It contains three screens: MainScreen, News and User (last one is available only for logged in user, otherwise Authentication screen will be shown). 

React Redux is used to store currently authenticated user and we get the user's name from the store to show it on the User screen.

Async Storage is used to store the information wheather the user is logged in on the device. After the successful authentication user stays logged in after restarting the app.
